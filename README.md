# Cohort Analysis: Customer Retention

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of customer retention using cohort analysis. The main focus is to provide insights into customer retention trends over time and recommend strategies to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Understanding the Cohort Analysis Chart

The cohort analysis chart tracks the retention of customers over time:
- Each **row** represents a cohort (group of customers acquired in a specific month).
- Each **column** represents the cohort index (number of months since acquisition).
- **Color intensity** indicates the retention rate of customers in a given cohort.

## Key Insights

### 1. Initial Retention
- Most cohorts show a significant drop in retention within the first 3 months.
- Possible reasons for churn include customer dissatisfaction, poor product fit, or competitive offerings.

### 2. Retention Patterns
- **Cohort 2010-12:** High retention throughout the period, indicating a strong product-market fit.
- **Cohorts 2011-01 to 2011-06:** Steady decline in retention, which could suggest issues with customer satisfaction or product-market fit.
- **Cohorts 2011-07 to 2011-12:** Mixed retention, with some stable and others declining.

### 3. Cohort-Specific Performance
